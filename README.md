# ObjectOrientedPhraseGame
This project uses oop to create a Javascript game that mimics hangman. The user has to click letters on screen or press them in the keyboard to figure out what is the hidden phrase. The user has five life represented by hearts, each error triggers a heart loss.


# Style

I decided to change the backgroundcolor of the winning screen and the losing screen. I also added an animation for the game title "Phrase Hunter".
